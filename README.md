# RoboBetty Dashboard
## Based on and using Bootstrap theme DashGum

#Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to show how I think this theme is useful for our CSE112 project: RoboBetty. I have changed
some of the elements in the theme to create a mock-up of what our dashboard could look like if we choose to use DashGum.
My changes were only to index.html , and thus the RoboBetty mockup is only reflected in that file.
